# Generative Models
# Bayes Classifier with Gaussian Mixture Models to generate handwritten images


### Note: This repository contains homework assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Glasgow, created while I served as the assistant lecturer and held a postdoctoral position, focusing on Python, deep learning, and associated tools.

Dataset used in this template is MNIST. You can change the dataset and implement the loading function in utils.py

The ayes Classifier with Gaussian Mixture Models is in Classifier.py

The main script load the data (preprocess it), fit the model on the MNIST, then it shows one sample for each class with its mean image learned. Finally, it generates a random sample.
